Relational algebra is a procedural query language, which takes instances of relations as input and yields instances of relations as output. 
It uses operators to perform queries. An operator can be either unary or binary. 
They accept relations as their input and yield relations as their output.
Relational algebra is performed recursively on a relation and intermediate results are also considered relations.

The fundamental operations of relational algebra are as follows −

Select
Project
Union
Set different
Cartesian product

We will discuss all these operations in the following sections.

Select Operation (σ)

It selects tuples that satisfy the given predicate from a relation.

Notation − σp(r)

Where σ stands for selection predicate and r stands for relation. 
p is prepositional logic formula which may use connectors like and, or, and not.
These terms may use relational operators like − =, ≠, ≥, < ,  >,  ≤.

Example:

Output − Selects tuples from books where subject is 'database'.
σsubject = "database"(Books);

Output − Selects tuples from books where subject is 'database' and 'price' is 450.
σsubject = "database" and price = "450"(Books);

Output − Selects tuples from books where subject is 'database' and 'price' is 450 or those books published after 2010.
σsubject = "database" and price = "450" or year > "2010"(Books);
