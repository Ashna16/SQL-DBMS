The following points explain the differences between delete and truncate command:

1.The DELETE statement is used when we want to remove some or all of the records from the table, 
   while the TRUNCATE statement will delete entire rows from a table.

2. DELETE is a DML command as it only modifies the table data, whereas the TRUNCATE is a DDL command.

3. DELETE command can filter the record/tuples by using the WHERE clause. 
However, the TRUNCATE command does not allow to use WHERE clause, so we cannot filter rows while truncating.

4. DELETE activates all delete triggers on the table to fire. 
However, no triggers are fired on the truncate operation because it does not operate on individual rows.

5.DELETE performs deletion row-by-row one at a time from the table, in the order, they were processed.
 However, TRUNCATE operates on data pages instead of rows because it deleted entire table data at a time.

6. DELETE statement only deletes records and does not reset the table's identity,
 whereas TRUNCATE resets the identity of a particular table.

7. DELETE command require more locks and database resources because it acquires the lock on every deleted row.
   In contrast, TRUNCATE acquires the lock on the data page before deleting the data page; thus, it requires fewer locks and few resources.

8. DELETE statement makes an entry in the transaction log for each deleted row 
   whereas, TRUNCATE records the transaction log for each data page.

9. TRUNCATE command is faster than the DELETE command as it deallocates the data pages instead of rows and records 
data pages instead of rows in transaction logs.

10. Once the record deletes by using the TRUNCATE command, we cannot recover it back. 
In contrast, we can recover the deleted data back which we removed from the DELETE operation.


*** NOTE : Both commands remove only data from the table and structure still persists.
