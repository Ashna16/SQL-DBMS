The Logical Data Model is used to define the structure of data elements and to set relationships between them. 
The logical data model adds further information to the conceptual data model elements. 
The advantage of using a Logical data model is to provide a foundation to form the base for the Physical model. 
However, the modeling structure remains generic.

At this Data Modeling level, no primary or secondary key is defined. 
At this Data modeling level, you need to verify and adjust the connector details that were set earlier for relationships.

Characteristics of a Logical data model

Describes data needs for a single project but could integrate with other logical data models based on the scope of the project.
Designed and developed independently from the DBMS.
Data attributes will have datatypes with exact precisions and length.
Normalization processes to the model is applied typically till 3NF.
