The ability to modify schema definition in one level without affecting the schema definition in higher level is called 
as DATA INDEPENDENCE.
In simple words,it is the technique that allows the data to be changed without affecting the applications that process it.

There are two types of Data Independence:
1. Physical data independence
2. Logical data independence


1. PHYSICAL DATA INDEPENDENCE

The ability to modify the physical schema w/o causing the application programs to be re-written.
Modification at this level are usually to improve performance of database.


2. LOGICAL DATA INDEPENDENCE

The ability to modify the conceptual schema w/o causing application program to be returned usually done when logical structure of database
is altered.Logical data independence are hard to achieve as the application program are highly dependent on logical structure of the data.
