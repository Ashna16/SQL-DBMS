Relational Model (RM) represents the database as a collection of relations.
A relation is nothing but a table of values. Every row in the table represents a collection of related data values. 
These rows in the table denote a real-world entity or relationship.

The table name and column names are helpful to interpret the meaning of values in each row. 
The data are represented as a set of relations. In the relational model, data are stored as tables. 
However, the physical storage of the data is independent of the way the data are logically organized.


Relational Model Concepts in DBMS

Attribute: Each column in a Table. Attributes are the properties which define a relation. e.g., Student_Rollno, NAME,etc.

Tables – In the Relational model the, relations are saved in the table format. It is stored along with its entities. 
A table has two properties rows and columns. Rows represent records and columns represent attributes.

Tuple – It is nothing but a single row of a table, which contains a single record.

Relation Schema: A relation schema represents the name of the relation with its attributes.

Degree: The total number of attributes which in the relation is called the degree of the relation.

Cardinality: Total number of rows present in the Table.

Column: The column represents the set of values for a specific attribute.

Relation instance – Relation instance is a finite set of tuples in the RDBMS system. Relation instances never have duplicate tuples.

Relation key – Every row has one, two or multiple attributes, which is called relation key.

Attribute domain – Every attribute has some pre-defined value and scope which is known as attribute domain
