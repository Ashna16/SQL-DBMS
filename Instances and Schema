INSTANCES: The collection of information stored in the datbase at a particular moment is c/a instance.
           The value of the variable declared in the program are corresponding to the instance.



SCHEMA: Database are used to store the data or information.The content of the databse gets changed as the data or 
        information may be added or deleted from it.
        Overall design of the databse is known as schema.The database schema are partitioned at different level of abstraction.
        It is related with the variable which are declared in the program.It doesnot get changed frequently.


1. PHYSICAL SCHEMA:

The schema designed on the physical level is c/a physical schema.It is below the logical level and can be easily changed without affecting
the application program.

2.LOGICAL SCHEMA :
The schema designed at logical level is known as logical schema.It is very important as it directly affects the apllication program.
This is because the programs are constructed based on logical schema,so if that changes then it also affects the application program.


3. SUB SCHEMA:
The schema designed at view level are called the Sub-Schema.
