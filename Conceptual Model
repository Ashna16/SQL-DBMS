Conceptual Data Model

A Conceptual Data Model is an organized view of database concepts and their relationships. 
The purpose of creating a conceptual data model is to establish entities, their attributes, and relationships. 
In this data modeling level, there is hardly any detail available on the actual database structure. 
Business stakeholders and data architects typically create a conceptual data model.

The 3 basic tenants of Conceptual Data Model are

Entity: A real-world thing
Attribute: Characteristics or properties of an entity
Relationship: Dependency or association between two entities

Data model example:

Customer and Product are two entities. Customer number and name are attributes of the Customer entity
Product name and price are attributes of product entity
Sale is the relationship between the customer and product
