- Constraints are used to operate database related operations according to certain rules.

- Integrity is the mechanism used to avoid the invalid data entry in the database.
It is of three types:

1. Domain Integrity: 

Here we check if the value entered in the rows is from the given range or not.

Which consists of:

- NOT NULL:
It is used to avoid absence of values in a row or a column.User cannot keep a not null value empty.

Eg:
Create table emp (ename char(5) NOT NULL , eid number(10));
Alter table emp modify eid number (10) NOT NULL;

-CHECK :
Use to avoid entering unnecessary values to columns.

Eg:
Create table stu (sname char(50 , marks number (3) check (marks<=100));

-DEFAULT
If no value is entered by default a default value will be put in that column.
Eg:
Create table stu (s_name char(5) , dept Varchar(5) default 'CSE');

2. Entity Integrity Constraints:

Defines constraints on tables, each row in the table can be identified by integrity constraint.

- Unique Constraints:
1. Avoids duplication of rows.
2. The duplication of values creates problems.

 EG:
 Create table stu (roll number (5) unique);

- Primary key constraints
1.Enforces two constraints,there should not be any duplication of value and value should not be null.
2. There can be number of unique key but one table can have only primary key.

Eg:Create table xyz (roll_no number(5) primary key);

3. Referential Constraint:

- Foreign key 
1. If there exists foreign key in one table then there has to be a primary key in another table.
2. It is used to set lin between two tables.

Eg: Create table tablename (colname datatype , colname datatype constraint name foreign key (this table's colname) references other-tablename (other table column));
