A Physical Data Model describes a database-specific implementation of the data model. 
It offers database abstraction and helps generate the schema. This is because of the richness of meta-data offered by a Physical Data Model. 
The physical data model also helps in visualizing database structure by replicating database column keys, constraints, indexes, triggers,
and other RDBMS features.


Characteristics of a physical data model:

1. The physical data model describes data need for a single project or application though it maybe integrated with other physical 
data models based on project scope.
2. Data Model contains relationships between tables that which addresses cardinality and nullability of the relationships.
3. Developed for a specific version of a DBMS, location, data storage or technology to be used in the project.
4. Columns should have exact datatypes, lengths assigned and default values.
5. Primary and Foreign keys, views, indexes, access profiles, and authorizations, etc. are defined.
